# calculator
Final foundations project for The Odin Project. 

In this project, I practiced: 
- using tools like: reduce, forEach, switch statement, slice, join, functions, DOM selectors & methods
- Adding and removing elements from array
- Debugging with DOM

Difficulties: 
- Getting number clicked, adding it to an array using slice & join (to attain double digits), converting it into an int to be used in operations.
- Coming up with system that allows me to use multiple operators (add, subtract).

Have a couple of things to do: 
1. Add keyboard funcitonality (started underneath keyboard section)
2. Change button colour when clicked
3. Add decimal capability
4. Fix AC, as you currently can't add input after it is clicked.
