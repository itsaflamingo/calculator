# calculator
Final foundations project for The Odin Project. 

In this project, I practiced: 
- using tools like: reduce, forEach, switch statement, slice, join, functions, DOM selectors & methods, parseFloat 
- Adding and removing elements from array
- Debugging with DOM

Difficulties: 
- Getting number clicked, adding it to an array using slice & join (to attain double digits), converting it into an int to be used in operations.
- Coming up with system that allows me to use multiple operators (add, subtract).

What I learned: 
- Separate long pieces of code into separate functions (no spaghetti code)
- Didn't have to use reduce for calculations (keep it simple)
- Read instructions more clearly:')

Have a couple of things to do: 
1. Change button colour when clicked
